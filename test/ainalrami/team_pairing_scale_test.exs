  @moduledoc """
  The 2026-09-16 speed-up of the team engine, checked against what it
  replaced.

  A 2026-09-14 run of 150 generated events of 100-500 teams found six
  refused with `:budget_exhausted` and 30% of the rounds at 300-500 teams
  over ten seconds. The fix changed HOW three questions are answered - is
  this set of teams pairable, which upfloater sets come in which order, and
  how many upfloaters the next bracket needs - and precomputed what the 3.6
  walk asks. None of it may change WHAT is answered. Each test below pins one
  of those invariants against an independent answer: the pre-change walk kept
  verbatim (`Ainalrami.Test.TeamBracketReference`), brute force, or the
  engine's own older path (`field: nil`), which still exists for histories
  the fast paths refuse.
