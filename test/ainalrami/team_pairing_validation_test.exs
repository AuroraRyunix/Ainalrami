defmodule Ainalrami.TeamPairingValidationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  C.04.6 validation beyond the single bracket: whole rounds against a
  brute-force reading of the text, the absolute criteria on large fields, and
  hand-worked positions for each criterion of Article 3.5.

  ## The reference is written from the regulation, not from the engine

  `ref_round/2` below is a second implementation of Articles 3.4-3.6 and 4,
  deliberately naive: it enumerates EVERY subset of the lower teams as an
  upfloater set and EVERY pairing of a bracket, decides pairability by
  trying every partner, and ranks by the criteria in 2.3's priority order.
  It shares no code with `Ainalrami.TeamPairing` beyond the `%Team{}`
  struct. Where the two agree on hundreds of reachable rounds, what is left
  to argue about is the reading - which the reference states in the open -
  not the search.

  Its readings, identical to the engine's by design (each is isolated there
  in a named function):

    * [C4] then [C5] are judged over LEGAL sets (bracket pairable and the
      rest pairable - [C1] and [C3]);
    * [C5] maximises the upfloaters' scores taken in ascending order
      (open question 5 - the article, not the 3.5.4 example);
    * [C6] minimises how many more upfloaters than the parity minimum the
      following scoregroup's bracket would need;
    * [C7] minimises the upfloaters that floated last round, before 3.5.4's
      order (open question 7);
    * 3.6: least {C8, C10}, then the smallest identifier. Type A only here;
      Type B's [C9] is proven at bracket level in `team_pairing_test.exs`.

  ## Histories are reachable

  Random `%Team{}` structs can describe tournaments no event produces (a
  team on 4 match points after one round). So every history here is PLAYED:
  a field starts empty and each round is paired by the engine and then given
  random results - including matches forfeited as a whole, pairing-allocated
  byes, and teams sitting a round out - and the next round is paired from
  that. Every round along the way is checked.
