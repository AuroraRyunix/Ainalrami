defmodule Ainalrami.TiebreakReference do
  @moduledoc """
  A deliberately naive second implementation of FIDE C.07 tie-breaks
  (effective 1 March 2026), written straight from
  `docs/c07-regulation-text.md`, for comparison with `Ainalrami.Tiebreaks`.

  It shares NO code with `lib/ainalrami/tiebreaks*`: no calls, no helpers,
  not even the code parser or the rating tables (transcribed again here from
  the FIDE Rating Regulations). It builds its own event model from what the
  engine is handed - a parsed TRF (`from_trf/2`, from `Ainalrami.Trf.parse/1`,
  not from `Ainalrami.Tiebreaks.Event.from_trf/2`) or the raw data of a
  `%Ainalrami.Tiebreaks.Team{}` (`from_team/1`, fields only).

  Clarity over speed: everything is recomputed on demand, lists are scanned
  from the start, and Article 6.3's "whatever the outcome of the missing
  games" is checked by enumerating the outcomes when there are few enough.

  The readings are the ones recorded in `docs/conformance-c07-tiebreaks.md`
  ("reading N" below) - agreement proves the engine computes THOSE readings,
  not that they are FIDE's. Why and how it is used:
  `docs/tiebreak-reference.md`.

  ## The model

      %{n: rounds counted, total: announced rounds, rr?: pairings fixed in
        advance (Article 15.2), win:, draw:, loss:, ids: [id],
        p: %{id => %{tpn:, rating: nil | integer, r: %{round => rd}}}}

  where a round `rd` is `%{t:, opp:, col:, pts:, res:}`, `t` one of
  `:game` (over the board), `:fwin`, `:floss`, `:pab`, `:fbye`, `:hbye`,
  `:zbye`, and `res` `:w | :d | :l`.
