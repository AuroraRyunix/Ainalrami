defmodule Ainalrami.Test.FuzzTournament do
  @moduledoc """
  Generates the random tournaments every comparison harness measures, and
  plays them forward on a reference engine's answers.

  ## Why this is a module rather than a copy in each harness

  It used to live inside `Ainalrami.BbppairingsComparisonTest`, which was
  fine while that was the only harness that generated anything.
  `Ainalrami.ThreeWayComparisonTest` had its own generator, and the two had
  drifted badly: the two-way one produces byes, forfeits, forbidden pairs,
  acceleration, withdrawals, five rating shapes and a variable round count,
  and the three-way one produced none of them - uniform ratings, no byes, a
  fixed round count.

  That gap mattered more than it looks. The three-way harness exists to
  measure how far the two REFERENCES agree with each other, which is the
  precision of the ruler every other number in this project is quoted with.
  Measuring that on plain tournaments only, when both known disputes in
  2.5 billion pairings are about byes, bounds the references' agreement in
  exactly the region where nobody doubted it.

  So generation lives here once, and a harness supplies only the part that
  is its own: who gets asked, and what counts as a disagreement.

  ## The seed is the whole tournament

  `begin!/3` reseeds `:rand` from the seed alone, so seed *n* produces the
  same tournament whether it is reached first or 735,264 tournaments in.
  Every dumped disagreement in `docs/` is reproducible from its seed on
  that basis, which is why the ORDER of the draws below is load-bearing:
  inserting a random call before an existing one renumbers every tournament
  in every corpus this project has ever run. The code here was moved
  verbatim out of the two-way harness for that reason, comments included,
  rather than tidied on the way.

  ## Knobs

  All read from the environment, all optional:

  `PAIRING_FUZZ_ROUNDS`/`_ROUNDS_MAX`, `_MIN_PLAYERS`/`_MAX_PLAYERS`,
  `_BYE_PCT`, `_FORFEIT_PCT`, `_FORBIDDEN_PCT`, `_ACCEL`,
  `_INITIAL_COLOUR`, `_NUMERIC_EXT`, `_RATING_MODE`, `_WITHDRAW_PCT`.

  `_ROUNDS_MAX`, `_ACCEL=mixed`, `_INITIAL_COLOUR=mixed`,
  `_NUMERIC_EXT=mixed` and `_RATING_MODE=mixed` each draw PER TOURNAMENT
  rather than fixing a value for the run, which is what explores
  combinations nobody thought to write down.

  # Late entrants (C.04.2:2.3-2.5). Article 2.4: "A Late Entry is a
  # participant who is only taken into account for the pairing of rounds
  # after the first [round they missed]... late entries receive no points
  # for unplayed rounds (unless the rules of the tournament say otherwise),
  # and are given an appropriate TPN and paired only when they actually
  # arrive." Article 2.3/2.5: the pre-round-one ranking gives everyone a
  # TPN, but "the TPNs given at the start of the tournament are
  # provisional. The definitive TPNs are given only when the List of
  # Participants is closed."
  #
  # Two things had to be checked against the real binary rather than argued
  # from the text alone, and both are grounded in a real TRF file (the
  # 2026-08-30 Tonoli Memorial, `C:\Users\jorian\Downloads`) plus direct
  # bbpPairings invocation from this repo:
  #
  # 1. **Missed rounds are `0000 - Z`, not a blank/absent column.** That
  #    file's own late entrant (rank 103) carries exactly that shape for
  #    every round before entry - opponent 0000, no colour, result code Z
  #    (`zero_point_bye`) - the same shape a full withdrawal uses. It
  #    round-trips through this engine's reader (`Trf.parse/1`,
  #    `points_for/2`) and through bbpPairings' fixed-width rows; an
  #    actually-empty result column is a different and malformed shape (see
  #    `pad_to_last_round/2`'s note on why a short MID-file column makes
  #    bbpPairings reject the whole file).
  #
  # 2. **The TPN sequence handed to bbpPairings has to be gap-free.**
  #    Confirmed the hard way: keeping a late entrant's ORIGINAL rank and
  #    simply omitting its `001` row for rounds before entry - the first
  #    version of this knob - made bbpPairings refuse the file outright
  #    ("A pairing number is missing") the moment the omitted rank was not
  #    the highest one. And a `0000` player is NOT invisible to bbpPairings'
  #    own pairing decision: a probe run over 30 seeds found it pairing
  #    every not-yet-entered player it could see, round 1 included, which
  #    only agrees with 2.4 by accident on axes where nobody happens to be
  #    ranked below every late entrant.
  #
  #    So TPNs are reassigned here, once, at `begin!` time - matching 2.5's
  #    "provisional... reassigned" wording - so that the ACTIVE set at every
  #    round is always the gap-free prefix `1..(N-K+j)`: every player who
  #    was never late keeps its relative order in `1..(N-K)`, and every late
  #    entrant is appended after them in `(entry_round, original rank)`
  #    order. A player not yet due is then simply left out of the roster
  #    handed to `build_trf/3` and to the engine under test - genuinely
  #    absent from the file, exactly as an arbiter's software has nothing to
  #    write for someone who has not walked in yet - and is revealed, with
  #    its Z-filled history backfilled in one step to match the real file,
  #    on the round it enters. Because the TPN assignment already fixes
  #    every late entrant after everyone who is never late, the active
  #    prefix never has a hole to begin with.
  #
  # Default is the zero-point case FIDE calls "usual" (2.4's own aside).
  # `PAIRING_FUZZ_LATE_BYE_TYPE=H` switches every late entrant's missed
  # rounds to a half-point bye instead - a second, opt-in mode, kept
  # deliberately separate from and off by default relative to `Z`.

  #
  # Harmless on every point system but one. `paid_forfeit` sets
  # `zero_point_bye: 0.5`, and `PAIRING_FUZZ_POINT_SYSTEM=mixed` draws it one
  # time in eight - so with withdrawals switched on, a player out for two or
  # more rounds carried a points column short by 0.5 per round. bbpPairings
  # recomputes the score from the results and rejects a file it cannot
  # reconcile, which makes this an INSTRUMENT bug: the harness generates a
  # file the reference refuses, and a refusal is not a disagreement about
  # pairing. Three instrument bugs have been found in this harness before,
  # all of the same kind - it measured something other than what it claimed.
