defmodule Ainalrami.TeamProof.ExactReference do
  @moduledoc """
  An exact, polynomial reading of C.04.6 Articles 3.4-3.6 for whole rounds -
  the naive reference's definition, computed without its enumeration, so it
  stays tractable at 80 teams. Method, proofs and measurements are written
  up in `docs/team-proof-large-fields.md`; this moduledoc is the summary.

  ## Independent of the engine

  It shares no code with `Ainalrami.TeamPairing.*`, `Ainalrami.WeightedMatching`
  or `Ainalrami.Matching`. Its one algorithmic tool is
  `Ainalrami.TeamProof.Blossom`, a minimum-cost perfect matching written for
  it. It reuses the NAIVE reference's Article 4 (`ref_colours/4`,
  `ref_numbers/2`, `ref_preference/1` - per pair, already polynomial, and
  itself written from the text), and nothing else.

  ## Readings - the naive reference's, unchanged

    * [C1]: two teams have met when either lists the other.
    * 3.4: [C2] first, then lowest score, most matches played (the played
      colours), largest TPN; the first that leaves the rest pairable.
    * [C4] then [C5] judged over LEGAL sets - the bracket pairable and the
      teams left behind pairable ([C1], [C3]).
    * [C5] maximises the upfloaters' scores taken in ascending order.
    * [C6] minimises how many more upfloaters than the parity minimum the
      following scoregroup (the highest score among the lower teams) would
      need; 0 when every team of that score floated.
    * [C7] minimises upfloaters that floated last round, before 3.5.4's
      order; off in the last two rounds, as is [C10].
    * 3.6: least {C8, C10} (C8 before C10), then the smallest identifier.
      Type A preferences only.

  ## Why it is exact - the three facts it rests on

  1. **Every criterion here is a lexicographic comparison of counts**, and a
     lexicographic comparison of bounded counts is an integer comparison
     once each count is given its own digit in a wide enough base
     (`pack/2`). So "least in the ordering" becomes "cheapest perfect
     matching" when every count is a sum over the matching's edges.

  2. **Upfloater sets are matchings of the whole remaining field.** If S is
     a legal set of the smallest size, every member of S is paired with a
     resident in EVERY pairing of the bracket: were two members paired with
     each other, dropping both would leave a smaller legal set. So the sets
     of minimal size are exactly "the lower teams matched to a resident" in
     the perfect matchings of the remaining field that use fewest
     resident-lower edges, and [C4], [C5], [C7] and 3.5.4's order are sums
     over those edges. [C6]'s look-ahead has the same shape one level down:
     for a fixed S, the fewest upfloaters into the following scoregroup is
     the fewest edges between that scoregroup and the teams below it in a
     perfect matching of what S leaves behind - so the SAME matching carries
     it, and minimising the joint cost minimises [C6] over S.

  3. **Identifier order is a sum too.** Among sets of equal size, the one
     whose sorted list is lexicographically first is the one whose smallest
     element of the symmetric difference it contains - i.e. the one with the
     larger sum of `2^(size - index)`. 3.6.2's identifier is the top members
     sorted (all pairings have the same number of tops) and then the bottoms
     in the tops' order: one matching picks the top set, a second, confined
     to that top set, picks the bottoms with a base-`h` positional digit per
     top. 3.5.4's order of sets is the same argument on the lower teams
     ordered by (score descending, TPN).

  So a round is a handful of matchings - one per bye candidate tried, one
  per bracket for the upfloaters (plus at most three for the recorded
  reason), two per bracket for 3.6 - where the naive reference enumerates
  every subset and every pairing.
