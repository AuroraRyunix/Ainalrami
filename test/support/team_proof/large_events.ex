  Played C.04.6 events shaped like real large team tournaments, for the
  100-200 team proof (`test/ainalrami/team_proof_xl_test.exs`).

  `Ainalrami.TeamProof.Events` plays one shape: 4 boards, coin-flip boards,
  3-9 rounds, one team in twelve sitting out. That is a fine way to reach
  odd histories and a poor likeness of an Olympiad. This generator draws a
  SHAPE per seed and plays that:

    * 100-200 teams, 4-6 boards, 7-11 rounds;
    * results either flat (every board a coin with a draw side) or RATED
      (team strength falls with the TPN, so the field sorts itself into the
      long thin scoregroups a real event has, with a spread drawn per event);
    * teams sitting a round out, teams WITHDRAWING for good, late entrants
      joining in round 2 or 3, matches forfeited as a whole - each at a rate
      drawn per event, including zero;
    * odd fields (and so pairing-allocated byes) whenever the head-count of
      the round happens to be odd, which absences make happen about half
      the time.

  Colour histories, float flags, byes and forfeit wins are whatever the
  played rounds produced; nothing is invented. As in `Events`, every round is
  paired by the caller's function (the engine), given results, and the next
  round is paired from that. Its own random stream: a seed here is not the
  same event as that seed in `Events`.
