defmodule Ainalrami.Test.Gacrux do
  @moduledoc """
  Thin wrapper for invoking Otto Milvang's `pairingchecker.py` (the pairing
  half of the FIDE Tie Break Server, gacrux.no) locally - the THIRD
  independent Dutch implementation this project compares against, after
  `Ainalrami.Test.Javafo` and `Ainalrami.Test.Bbppairings`.

  Worth having for two reasons the other two cannot cover.

  It implements a NEWER rulebook. `pairingdutch.py` carries

      DUTCH_RULES = { 0: "2022-01-01",
                      1: "2026-02-01" }  # Approved by FIDE Council on 01/02/2026

  and selects the 2026 one. bbpPairings 6.0.0 also implements the revised
  rules ("the 2025 rules ... effective date delayed to 2026"), but JaVaFo
  2.2 predates them, so without this there is no way to tell a genuine
  disagreement from a rulebook difference.

  And it breaks ties. Most of this engine's remaining disagreements are
  cases where several pairings satisfy every documented criterion equally
  and the reference simply picked one; with two references a tie is a
  coin-toss between them, with three it is a majority.

  NOT vendored, same reasoning as the other two - third-party source that
  is not ours to redistribute. Located via `GACRUX_DIR`, defaulting to a
  sibling checkout of <https://github.com/OttoMilvang/TieBreakServer>.
  Its only dependency is `networkx`.

  ## Output format

  Confirmed by direct invocation, not assumed: `-p -dT` writes the same
  shape javafo and bbpPairings do - a count line, then one `white black`
  per pair, `0` for a pairing-allocated bye - so `parse_output/1` is the
  same logic as theirs.

  # Gacrux reads stdin on paths this harness does not deliberately take -
  # `commonmain.py` does it whenever it decides the input file is `-` - and
  # 36 workers each blocked in `read(0, ...)` is a run that never finishes

  # a pipe.
  #
  # **A single invocation must not be able to stall the run.** `timeout`
  # bounds it and exit 124 becomes a reported error, so a hang costs one
  # round and a loud failure instead of a whole night.

  # Gacrux reports failure INSIDE the output file, with exit status 0:

  # found on seed 21 with byes on.

  # 510 USED to be treated as "no legal pairing here", on the argument that
  # the assumption was being measured rather than hidden: the three-way
  # harness records every round where one reference refuses while the other
  # pairs, so a wrong reading would surface as a pile of exhaustion splits.
  #
  # It did, and the assumption is now falsified - though not in the way it
  # first appeared, and the difference matters. The 2026-08-24 run produced
  # 234 such splits; re-running Gacrux on every one found 203 were
  # `### Error 510` and 31 a genuinely empty pairing list. Under `-v` Gacrux
  # re-raises instead of swallowing, and all 60 sampled 510s were the same
  # exception, `crosstabledutch.py:253 KeyError: 'n'`, which read like a
  # single bug. That sample was biased by construction: a split is only
  # DUMPED when bbpPairings paired the position, so it can only ever contain
  # the crash that fires on pairable positions. Sampled without that filter,
  # 510 has at least three sites and they do not mean the same thing:

  #                            RuntimeError. It is where Gacrux means "this

  #                            bbpPairings independently found no legal

  # Deciding which crashes cost something needs the other engine's answer,
  # which this module does not have, so it reports the crash and the site
  # and leaves the judgement to the caller that can make it.
