defmodule Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Team do
  @moduledoc """
  A team as C.04.6 sees it, plus the derived quantities Articles 1.6 and 1.7
  define on top.

  The regulation text this implements is kept verbatim in
  `docs/c0406-regulation-text.md`; the reading decisions are in
  `docs/conformance-c0406-teams.md`. Article numbers below cite that text.

  ## What is deliberately NOT here

  **Board order.** The regulation never says how a team orders its own
  boards, nor whether that order may change between rounds - Article 0 says
  outright that individuals "can be substituted or shifted between the
  various boards". It is left to each competition, so it is the host
  application's to store and the arbiter's to set. An engine that derived it
  would be inventing a rule FIDE declined to write.

  **Player ratings, names, federations.** Article 0 also removes the
  individual system's initial-order rules (General Handling 2.1-2.3) because
  "there are too many variants to take into account to define an appropriate
  strength for teams". The TPN arrives already assigned (1.1.2: by the
  competition's rules, else the Chief Arbiter). This engine never computes a
  seeding.

  ## Fields

    * `:tpn` - Tournament Pairing Number, 1..N, unique (1.1.1).
    * `:match_points` / `:game_points` - both are needed. Which one is the
      *primary* score is a competition setting (1.2.1), the default is match
      points (1.2.2), and the other is used for colour allocation (4.2.2).
      A team model carrying one number cannot express 4.2, and the PAB pays
      in both (1.4).
    * `:opponents` - TPNs already played, for [C1]. A list, not a MapSet, so
      "who did we play in round 3" stays answerable; membership tests go
      through `met?/2`.
    * `:colours` - colours of matches ACTUALLY PLAYED, oldest first
      (1.6.1). A match with no colour is not a played match, so byes and
      unplayed matches are simply absent rather than recorded as `nil` - the
      list length is the played-match count.
    * `:had_pab?` - has already received a pairing-allocated bye, and so may
      not receive another ([C2], 2.1.2).
    * `:won_by_forfeit?` - won a match by forfeit, or was given a
      FIDE-deprecated full-point bye. [C2] bars these from the PAB on the
      same footing as a previous PAB, which is why they are one condition
      (`pab_ineligible?/1`) rather than three checks at the call site.
    * `:floated_last_round?` - was a floater (1.5: played an opponent with a
      different score) in the previous round. Read by [C7] and [C10], both
      of which stop applying in the last two rounds.
    * `:matches_played` - for the bye tie-break 3.4.3. Defaults to
      `length(colours)`; settable because a competition may count a
      forfeited match as played when this engine cannot know that.

  Colour preference under Article 1.7.

  Returns `{:white, :strong}`, `{:white, :mild}`, the Black equivalents, or
  `:none`. Type A never produces `:mild` - the strength is carried anyway so
  callers have one shape to match on, and [C9]/4.3.4 simply never fire.

  `type` is `:a` (the default, 1.7) or `:b`. `last_round?` matters only to
  Type B, whose mild preferences switch off when pairing the final round.

  ## The two types are not two rules

  Type B's STRONG conditions are word-for-word Type A's conditions. Type B
  adds mild preferences underneath them. So `preference/3` computes the
  shared condition once and Type B only asks the extra question when the
  shared one says nothing - which also makes it structurally impossible for
  the two to disagree about the strong case, a drift this codebase has been
  bitten by elsewhere.
