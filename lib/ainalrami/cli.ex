defmodule Ainalrami.CLI do
  @moduledoc """
  Command-line entry point. Deliberately mirrors JaVaFo's own invocation
  shape - `java -jar javafo.jar input.trf -p output.txt` (confirmed against
  the sibling project's real `System.cmd` call, not guessed) - as
  `ainalrami input.trf -p output.trf`, so a caller that already knows how to
  drive JaVaFo only has to swap the executable name, not rewrite its
  argument-building code. The same applies to JaVaFo's other two modes:
  `-c` (Pairings Checker, FPC) is implemented - it replays a completed
  tournament and diffs each round against what this engine would have
  paired, exiting nonzero if any round differs; a team Swiss is replayed
  team against team with the C.04.6 engine (`Ainalrami.TeamReplay`), a
  team round robin against the Berger tables, and a file whose system it
  cannot replay (an individual round robin, Scheveningen, Schiller,
  knockout, Dubov, Burstein, custom system ...) exits 2 with a message
  saying so. `-g` (Random Tournament Generator) is implemented too - it
  takes no input file, since it creates a tournament rather than reading
  one; `-g --team=swiss|roundrobin` generates a team event
  (`Ainalrami.TeamGenerator`).

  `-p` and `-x` on a team file pair the next round team against team
  (`Ainalrami.TeamCLI`, whose moduledoc defines the output format).

  `-s` prints the standings by the file's tie-break list, which is what
  `-c` checks the file's own ranks against.

  Every pairing option the library takes has a flag, a record in the file
  (`Ainalrami.Trf`, "The organiser's records"), or both; the flags are laid
  over the parsed file in `with_input_flags/2`, so each mode reads one
  place. docs/cli-parity.md is the table.

  Verbose trace is the default (see `Ainalrami.Log`); pass `-q`/`--quiet` to
  suppress it.

  `run/1` does the real work and returns a plain exit code, deliberately
  never calling `System.halt/1` itself - that would kill the test VM if
  called from ExUnit. `main/1` (the actual escript entry point) is the only
  place that halts.

  # BEFORE its round is paired - that is how the engine knows to leave the
  # player out - so a file waiting to have round N paired already carries a
  # round-N `H` or `Z` for everyone who asked to sit it out, and
  # `parse_games/1` sizes the list from the line. One such player made this
  # count one high, and the checker then diffed a round the file had never
  # paired: `recorded_pairs/2` discards every non-participating game, so
  # `actual` was `[]`, while `state_before_round/3` reconstructs exactly the
  # position that round is to be paired FROM and duly pairs it. Every file
  # with a pre-recorded bye for its pending round reported a spurious
  # mismatch on its last round and exited 1.
  #
  # A round counts as paired if ANY player took part in its pairing. Rounds
  # before that are counted too even if nobody's entry participated, which
  # is bbpPairings' rule as well: `trf.cpp:329-340` raises `playedRounds` to
  # `matches.size()` for any non-empty entry and to `matches.size() + 1`
  # only when `participatedInPairing`.
  #
  # bbpPairings on the same file reaches the same place by a different
  # route. Its reader pads every short history out to the pending round
  # with non-participating self-matches (`evenUpMatchHistories`), so its
  # checker does visit round N - and then finds every player sitting it out,
  # computes an empty matching, and prints nothing. Not checking the round

      -q, --quiet    Warnings and errors only

                   what it costs against the round that was paired
      --absent=N   With -x: N did not turn up - the least disruptive
                   legal fixes, each with who else moves and what it costs
      --judge=1-5,2-6,3-0   With -x: a whole other round (0 = the bye),
                   judged against the one that was paired
      --bye-alternatives    With -x: had each other player of the bye's
                   bracket taken the bye instead
      --float-alternatives  With -x: had each other player floated instead

    The tournament, over what the file says (-p, -x, -c):
      --rounds=N                the round count (142/XXR)
      --initial-colour=white|black   the drawing of lots (152/XXC)
      --points=3,1,0            the point system (BB*/162); or by name:
                                win:3,draw:1,loss:0,bye:1,forfeit-loss:0,

                                (also -s)
      --forbidden=1,4/2,9,12@3-5   forbidden groups, added to XXP/260;
                                @ROUND or @FIRST-LAST limits one to rounds
      --acceleration=baku       C.04.7's virtual points, worked out here for
                                a file with no XXA/250; needs the round count
      --baku-group-a=N          Group A's last starting rank, when the field
                                grew after round 1 (default: 2 x ceil(n/4))
      --virtual-points=1-10:1,1,0.5/11:0.5

      --half-bye=3,7 --zero-bye=12 --full-bye=20   (-p, -x) byes asked for
                                in the round being paired; zero = absent
      --cascade-order           (-p) boards in the order the brackets were
                                paired, not C.04.2 3.6's

    Bye preferences (-p and -x; an organiser's rule, NOT FIDE - a round they
    change is not a pure FIDE pairing, and a warning says so on stderr):
      --bye-want=RANKS       must get the pairing-allocated bye, if any legal
                             round gives it to them
      --bye-want-soft=RANKS  rather gets it: decides among the players on the
                             bye score, never lifts the bye to a higher score
      --bye-avoid=RANKS      must not get it (a bye exclusion)
      --bye-avoid-soft=RANKS rather not: someone else on the bye score takes
                             it if anyone can
      --bye-exclude=RANKS    the plain bye exclusion (the library's
                             :bye_exclusions): as --bye-avoid, reported as
                             the organiser's exclusion
      RANKS is starting ranks separated by commas, each optionally with the
      rounds it applies to: --bye-want=5,12@3-4+7 (12 in rounds 3, 4 and 7)
      In the file: XXO bye-want 5 12@3-4+7 (and bye-want-soft, bye-avoid,
      bye-avoid-soft, bye-exclude)
      (-c replays with them, and says it is not a pure FIDE check)

    Soft pairs (-p and -x; an organiser's wish, NOT FIDE, announced on stderr):
      --soft-pairs=1,4/2,9,12   groups of players to keep apart where the
                                criteria allow it (club protection, family);
                                2,9,12@3-5 for rounds 3 to 5 only
      --soft-position=strong|weak
                                strong (default): above C6, a float rather
                                than the pair; weak: after C21, ties only
      In the file: XXO soft-pairs 2 9 12 @3-5 / XXO soft-position weak

    Event formats (-p, -x, -c; also what the file's XXM and XXG lines say):
      --match-format            every match two games in a row, colours
                                reversed in the second: a Swiss pairs the odd
                                rounds and copies each even one reversed; a
                                round robin plays round k of one table as
                                rounds 2k-1 and 2k (CUSTOM_SWISS/_ROUNDROBIN)
      --groups=1-8/9-12,15      pairing groups (categories), each paired on
                                its own; ranks in no group form a last one;
                                a round robin plays one table per group
      -g takes --match-format (Swiss, --roundrobin, --team=roundrobin) and
