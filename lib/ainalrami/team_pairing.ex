defmodule Ainalrami.TeamPairing do
  @moduledoc """
  FIDE Swiss Team Pairing System, C.04.6, effective 1 February 2026.

  The regulation is kept verbatim in `docs/c0406-regulation-text.md` and the
  reading notes - written before any code existed, so the reading was checked
  against the regulation rather than against an implementation - are in
  `docs/conformance-c0406-teams.md`. Every article number below cites that
  text.

  ## This is not the Dutch system applied to teams

  Article 0 says the individual rules apply *mutatis mutandis*, and then
  C.04.6 defines its own criteria set, its own bye rule and its own
  procedure. Three differences change the shape of the code:

  | | individual (C.04.3) | teams (C.04.6) |
  |---|---|---|
  | criteria | C1-C21 | C1-C3 absolute/completion, C4-C10 quality |
  | bracket | best candidate under a weight ladder | **first** candidate in a defined enumeration |
  | score | one | **two** - primary and secondary |

  The second row is the important one. The individual engine's weight
  ladder is not used here at all: 3.6 defines an order and a predicate, not
  an optimum. Matching still earns its keep, but only to answer yes/no and
  how-many questions about the teams - [C3]'s *can what is left still be
  paired?*, and [C4]/[C6]'s *how few upfloaters can make it so?* -
  `Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Matching` and `Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Field`, the
  latter falling back on `Ainalrami.WeightedMatching` for an exact answer
  when a greedy pass cannot find a witness. Neither chooses a pairing.

  ## The procedure (3.3.2)

      1. assign the pairing-allocated bye, if the field is odd  (3.4)
      2. take the top-scoregroup, add upfloaters if it is odd   (3.5)
      3. pair that bracket                                      (3.6)
      4. repeat 2-3 until every team is paired
      5. allocate colours                                       (Article 4)

  ## Usage

      teams = [%Team{tpn: 1, match_points: 2.0}, ...]
      {:ok, round} = Ainalrami.TeamPairing.pair_round(teams, expected_rounds: 9)

      round.pairs  # [%{white: 3, black: 7, first_team: 3}, ...]
      round.bye    # the TPN that got the PAB, or nil

  ## Verification, which is unusually strong here

  There is no reference implementation to diff against - bbpPairings, JaVaFo
  and Gacrux have no team code, and Swiss-Manager is closed-source Windows
  software. That removes the corpus method the individual engine's
  credibility rests on.

  The regulation hands back something better, though. For the individual
  system, "which whole-round pairing is correct" has no defined answer -
  C.04.3 specifies a sequential procedure, not a global optimum. Here 3.6
  defines the answer *as* the first element of an enumerable order. So for a
  bracket small enough to enumerate exhaustively, a test can BE the
  definition: generate every pairing, sort by identifier, filter by the
  criteria, assert the engine returns the head. That is a proof rather than a
  correlation, and `test/ainalrami/team_pairing_test.exs` does it.

  Pairs one round.

  Returns `{:ok, %{pairs: [...], bye: tpn | nil, brackets: [...]}}` or
  `{:error, reason}`; with `explain: true` the map also has `:explanation`.

  Each entry in `pairs` is `%{white: tpn, black: tpn, first_team: tpn,
  score_difference: n}` - colours already allocated per Article 4, and
  `first_team` carried through because 4.2 decided it and a caller printing
  a match card usually wants it.

  Options:

    * `:score_mode` - `:match_points` (default, 1.2.2) or `:game_points`.
    * `:use_secondary?` - whether 4.2.2 may break a first-team tie. Default
      true.
    * `:type` - `:a` (default) or `:b` colour preferences (1.7).
    * `:initial_colour` - `:white` (default) or `:black`, drawn by lot
      before round one (4.1).
    * `:absent` - TPNs of teams that have ARRIVED (played, or held a bye, in
      an earlier round) but are not in this round's field: sitting a round
      out, or withdrawn after playing. They are not paired, but they keep
      their place in Article 4.3.1's arrival numbering, exactly as an absent
      player does on the individual side. A team that has never arrived is
      simply left out of both lists. A TPN in both `teams` and `:absent` is
      `{:error, {:invalid_option, :absent, tpns}}`.
    * `:max_upfloater_sets` - how many candidate upfloater sets 3.5 may
      examine for one set size, and the [C6] look-ahead for one count
      (default 200_000); beyond it the round is `{:error, :budget_exhausted}`.
      Only sets actually examined count, so a round that fits under the old
      reading (the number of sets of the size) fits under this one.
    * `:round` / `:expected_rounds` - both optional; together they decide
      "the last two rounds", which switch off [C7] and [C10], and "the last
      round", which switches off Type B mild preferences. Given neither, the
      engine assumes it is NOT near the end - the conservative choice, since
      it keeps criteria switched on.
    * `:max_candidates` / `:max_steps` - accepted and IGNORED since
      2026-09-25. They budgeted the 3.6 search, which is now exact by
      construction (two minimum-cost matchings per bracket when the first
      legal pairing is not already perfect - see
      `Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Bracket`), so a bracket is never cut short and
      `{:error, :budget_exhausted}` now comes only from
      `:max_upfloater_sets`.
    * `:explain` - when true, the result also carries `:explanation`: why
      the bye went where it did, which upfloater sets each bracket considered
      and what decided between them, and which rule of Article 4 gave each
      match its colours. Default false. Everything else in the result is
      identical either way. Shape and bound in
      `Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Explanation`.
    * `:explain_limit` - how many entries each recorded list keeps (default
      10); the rest are
      counted, not kept.

  ## Why it returns brackets too

  `brackets` reports what the procedure actually did - which teams formed
  each bracket, who upfloated into it, how many candidates 3.6's fast-path
  walk examined (0 when the matching answered) and `exhaustive?`, always
  true since 3.6 became exact. An arbiter asked to justify a pairing
  needs the bracket structure, not just the boards, and reconstructing it
  from the finished pairs is guesswork. This is the same reason the
  individual engine grew `explain_round/3`.

  `explain: true` goes the rest of the way: the REASONS, recorded where the
  decisions are made - which teams the bye passed over for 3.4.1, which
  upfloater sets were considered and rejected and the criterion that decided
  between the chosen set and the runner-up, and the Article 4 rule behind
  each board-1 colour. `Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Explanation` has the shape and
  its bound.

  Selects the set of upfloaters for the top-scoregroup (3.5).

  3.5.1 every team with a lower score is a potential upfloater. 3.5.2
  consider all sets complying with [C4] (minimise the count) and [C5]
  (maximise their scores). 3.5.3 within a set, sort by descending score then
  ascending TPN. 3.5.4 sort the sets among themselves lexicographically by
  their TPNs. 3.5.5 take the first that yields a legal pairing also
  complying with [C6] and [C7].

  `lower` is EVERY team still to be paired below the top-scoregroup, not a
  sample of it: [C3] is judged on what is left, so the residents and `lower`
  together must be an even field (the PAB already taken out). An odd one is
  `{:error, :odd_field}`.

  ## The order the criteria are applied in

  2.3 gives them "in descending priority", and that is the order here:

    1. **[C4]** - the fewest upfloaters. The bracket must be even (1.3.2), so
       the count starts at the residents' parity and grows by two, and a
       count is only accepted if some set of that size is LEGAL: the bracket
       it forms can be paired without a rematch ([C1]) and so can everything
       left below it ([C3]).
    2. **[C5]** - among the legal sets of that size, the best score profile
       (`c5_profile_key/2`, where open question 5 is isolated).
    3. **[C6]** - among those, the fewest extra upfloaters the following
       scoregroup's bracket would need (`c6_excess/4`).
    4. **[C7]** - then the fewest upfloaters that floated last round
       (`c7_previous_floaters/2`, where open question 7 is isolated).
    5. **3.5.4** - then the first set in lexicographic TPN order.

  This replaced a first cut that took the minimum count only for an ODD
  scoregroup (an even one could never float anyone in, so two residents who
  had met stopped the round), jumped to a larger set when the best-profile
  sets were illegal rather than relaxing [C5] first, never looked past the
  bracket for [C3], and applied neither [C6] nor [C7].

  # One set size ([C4] has fixed it). Every set of that size is ranked by

  # (the bracket can be paired, and so can everything left below it - [C1]
  # and [C3]) with the best [C5] profile any legal set has, taking among
  # those the least [C6], then the least [C7], then 3.5.4's order.
  #
  # ## Why [C5] is judged over legal sets, not all of them
  #
  # 3.5.2 reads as "[C4] and [C5] first, legality after". Taken literally
  # that leaves no answer when every set with the best score profile is
  # illegal but a set of the same size with a slightly lower profile is
  # fine - and the literal fallback, a larger set, would break [C4] to save
  # [C5], inverting their priority (2.3: "given in descending priority").
  # Judging [C5] among legal sets is the same answer whenever the literal
  # one exists, and the priority-respecting one when it does not.
  #
  # ## The sets are generated in order, not sorted (2026-09-16)
  #
  # This used to build every set of the size, sort them all, and walk the
  # sorted list - and refuse the round outright when there were more than
  # `:max_upfloater_sets` of them, however early the walk would have
  # stopped. `reduce_sets/6` produces the same sets in the same order one at
  # a time, so the walk below sees exactly what it saw before and stops
  # where it stopped before; the budget now counts the sets it actually
  # examines.
  #
  # ## What the explanation adds, and what it must not change
  #
  # The walk below decides exactly as it did before explanations existed:
  # `best` moves by the same three rules, and `rec` - nil unless explaining -
  # only watches. `stop` records where the walk ended, so `runner_up/9` can
  # look past that point for the set that came second without re-walking
  # anything the choice depended on.

  # Why this order is the sorted order:
  #
  #   * A set's profile is its scores ascending, negated. Listing which
  #     scoregroup each member comes from, lowest score first, gives a
  #     sequence of group numbers (highest score = 0) that never increases,
  #     and a SMALLER sequence is a larger score list - a better profile. So
  #     the profiles in order are those sequences in ascending lexicographic
  #     order, which `reduce_profiles/7` produces directly.
  #   * Within one profile every set takes the same number of teams from each
  #     group, and 3.5.3 lists them highest group first, by TPN within a
  #     group. Comparing two such TPN lists is comparing the choice from the
  #     highest group first, then the next: nested lexicographic
  #     combinations, which `reduce_combinations/5` produces.

  # OPEN QUESTION 5 ([C5] against the 3.5.4 example) - the reading lives
  # here and nowhere else.
  #
  # 2.3.2: "Minimise the score differences (taken in descending order) in the
  # pairs involving upfloaters, i.e. maximise the scores (taken in ascending
  # order) of the upfloaters." So a set's [C5] quality is its upfloaters'
  # scores sorted ascending, and a lexicographically LARGER list is better.
  # Returned negated so an ascending sort puts the best profile first.
  #
  # This follows the ARTICLE, and the profile is compared only among LEGAL
  # sets (`best_set_of_size/6` never reaches a set that fails
  # `legality/3`). The example under 3.5.4 - 2, 6, 8 on 3 points, 1, 3, 5
  # on 2.5, three upfloaters - says [C5] "determines that two upfloaters must
  # have 3 points and the other 2.5". Under this reading the example is right
  # exactly when {2, 6, 8} cannot be paired with the residents (or strands
  # the rest), which it does not say but does not rule out; when {2, 6, 8}
  # can be, this takes all three.
  #
  # The research note of 2026-09-13 (docs/conformance-c0406-teams.md,
  # "Research findings") settles the reading at medium-high confidence: the
  # identical example is in the 2024 edition and in Double-Swiss C.04.5,
  # both of whose [C5] is the same maximin, and 3.5.2's own note ("This
  # SOMEHOW determines the number of upfloaters in the set and their
  # scores") and Dubov 2026 3.2.1 ("needed to obtain a legal pairing") put
  # legality inside [C4]/[C5]. It is NOT [C6]: 3.5.5 says [C4] and [C5] are
  # met "by construction" before [C6] is consulted, and the 2024 example
  # predates [C6]'s "unless ... empty" clause. Not an SPP ruling; if one says
  # the profile comes from raw scores, this function and `legality/3`'s
  # place in the walk are what change.
  #
  # `0 - score` rather than `-score`: a negated float zero is `-0.0`, which
  # compares equal but is a different term, and the profiles are compared
  # with `!=` in `best_set_of_size/6`.

  #
  # "Unless all the teams in the following scoregroup became or are

  # upfloaters so that criteria [C1], [C3] and [C4] ... are complied with in
  # the bracket where this (not empty) scoregroup is paired." The following
  # scoregroup is the highest score below the residents; what is left of it
  # after this set floats up will be the residents of the next bracket. [C4]
  # there is "the fewest upfloaters", so the look-ahead finds the fewest that
  # give a bracket pairable under [C1] with everything below it still
  # pairable ([C3]). Only [C1], [C3] and [C4] - not [C5]: the next bracket's
  # upfloaters are not constrained by score for this question.
  #

  # OPEN QUESTION 7 ([C7] as a ranking in 3.5.5) - the reading lives here.
  #
  # 3.5.5 asks for "the first set that ... complies with [C6] and [C7]", and
  # [C7] (2.3.4) is a minimisation: "with the exception of the last two
  # rounds, minimise the number of upfloaters that were floaters in the
  # previous round". Read as a minimisation, a set complies by achieving the
  # least count any legal, [C6]-best set achieves, and among those 3.5.4's
  # order picks the first. That is what `best_set_of_size/6` does with the
  # number this returns.
  #
  # The two readings the SPP question names - rank by [C7] first then take
  # 3.5.4's order, or take the first set in 3.5.4's order that achieves the
  # minimum - choose the SAME set: both are "the lexicographically first
  # among the sets with the least count". The reading that actually differs
  # is the one this engine had before, which applied no [C7] at all and took
  # the first legal set. Making this function return 0 restores that.
  #
  # The research note of 2026-09-13 (docs/conformance-c0406-teams.md,
  # "Research findings") confirms this at high confidence: 2.3 applies the
  # quality criteria "as much as possible ... in descending priority" and
  # 3.5.4's order is only the final tie-break; "the first X that complies
  # with [a minimisation]" is the chapter's standing phrasing (3.6.4, the
  # 2024 edition's 2.2.5); Dubov 2026 3.2.2 says "complies at best"; and the
  # 2026 edition moved floater avoidance up into set selection, which only
  # matters if it can override the lexicographic order. Not an SPP ruling.
