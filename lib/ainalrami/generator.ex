defmodule Ainalrami.Generator do
  @moduledoc """
  Random Tournament Generator (RTG) - JaVaFo's `-g` role.

  Builds a random roster, then plays it forward: each round is paired by
  `Ainalrami.Pairing` itself and given random results. That the generator
  pairs with the engine under test is deliberate and matches bbpPairings'
  own RTG (`tournament/generator.cpp` calls `computeMatching` inside its
  round loop) - the point of an RTG in FIDE's FE1 auto-test is to produce
  tournaments whose pairings a *reference checker* can then verify, so the
  pairings have to be the candidate program's own.

  ## Reproducibility

  Every tournament is generated from a seed, and the seed is recorded in
  the file so any run can be reproduced from its own output. Given
  `:seed`, the same options always give the same bytes. Without it a fresh
  seed is drawn per call from the clock and the process, so two runs - in
  one VM or in two - get different tournaments (FIDE's VCL4THP asks that
  an RTG run twice with the same parameters not repeat itself), and the
  seed it drew is in the file and returned, so the run can be repeated.

  bbpPairings writes the seed as the literal first line of the output,
  before generating anything, so a crash still leaves it recoverable. That
  would make the file invalid TRF, so this writes it into the tournament
  name (`012`) instead - the first line of a TRF anyway, valid, and
  carried by every parser. The recoverable-on-crash property is kept by
  choosing the seed before any generation work happens.

  ## What it varies

  Roster size, round count, ratings, and results. Optionally forfeits,
  arbiter-assigned byes, `XXP` forbidden pairings and `XXA` acceleration -
  all four off by default, see `generate/1`.

  With `unset: :random` (what `ainalrami -g` uses) the checklist axes the
  caller left out are drawn too: each kind of bye, forfeits, unusual
  results, Baku acceleration and a tie-break list are each switched on with
  probability `:unset_chance` percent and given a random level, and
  results follow the FIDE rating table. The default, `unset: :fixed`,
  leaves them off, so every seed recorded before this existed still
  produces the bytes it always did.

  Retirements are NOT modelled: a retired player is expressed as a run of
  arbiter-assigned byes to the end of the tournament, which
  `:requested_bye_pct` already produces in isolated rounds, and nothing in
  the pairing rules treats a run of them differently from single ones.

  alias Ainalrami.{Pairing, Trf}

  @doc """
  Generates a tournament and returns its TRF16 text.

  Options, all optional:

    * `:seed` - integer seed; a random one is chosen and reported if absent
    * `:players` - roster size (default: random 10..60)
    * `:rounds` - rounds to play (default: random 5..11, capped so the
      field can't run out of legal opponents)
    * `:forfeit_pct` - percentage of games forfeited (default 0)
    * `:requested_bye_pct` - percentage of players granted an
      arbiter-assigned half- or zero-point bye each round (default 0)
    * `:forbidden_pct` - percentage of players given one arbiter-forbidden
      opponent, emitted as `XXP` lines (default 0)
    * `:acceleration` - `:baku` for FIDE C.04.7's virtual points, or
      `:random` for arbitrary per-player-per-round ones; emitted as `XXA`
      lines (default: none)
    * `:names` - `:ascii` (default) for `Player17`, or `:unicode` to draw
      surnames with multibyte characters
    * `:unset` - `:fixed` (default) leaves every checklist option the
      caller did not give off; `:random` draws them - see "Unset options"
    * `:unset_chance` - with `unset: :random`, the percentage chance that
      each one is switched on (default 50)

  `:players` must be a positive integer and `:rounds` a non-negative one.
  Either given otherwise raises `ArgumentError` rather than being quietly
  turned into a tournament nobody asked for - see `validate_count!/3`.

  Returns `{trf_text, seed}`.
