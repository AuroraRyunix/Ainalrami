defmodule Ainalrami.TeamCLI do
  @moduledoc """
  The team half of `ainalrami input.trf -p` and `-x`: the next round of a
  team event, team against team, read from a TRF26 team file (`310`
  rosters, `001` games, `362`/`320`/`330`/`300` records) - see
  `Ainalrami.TeamReplay` for how the file is read.

    * a C.04.6 team Swiss (`192 FIDE_TEAM...`, or a file whose games show a
      team event) is paired by `Ainalrami.TeamPairing` with the settings
      the `192` code names - colour preferences, primary score, whether the
      secondary score allocates colours - the initial colour of `152` (or
      the one round 1 shows), the round count of `142`/`XXR`, and the
      teams sitting the round out passed as absent;
    * a team round robin (`192 BERGER_TEAM_ROUNDROBIN_Gn` and its aliases,
      or a `092` round robin whose games show teams) is given the next
      round of the Berger table (`Ainalrami.Berger`).

  ## The output (`-p`)

  JaVaFo's pairing list, one level up - a count line and one line per
  match, CRLF throughout:

      3            matches in the round, the bye counted as one
      1 4          the team with White on board 1, then its opponent
      5 2
      3 0          a team with no opponent: the pairing-allocated bye
                   (Swiss) or the Berger table's free round (round robin)

  Matches come in C.04.2 3.6's recommended order (the higher score of the
  pair's first team, then the higher sum of both scores, then the smaller
  number of the first team) for a Swiss, and by the lower team number for
  a round robin; the bye last. Team numbers are the `310` numbers (file
  order for `013` teams).

  With `--lineups` the boards follow, as a second block:

      12           board lines
      1 1 3 17     match (line number above, from 1), board, White, Black
      1 2 18 4     - players' starting ranks, 0 for a board nobody fills

  A team's players are seated in the order of a `300` record for the round
  when the file has one, otherwise its free players in roster order - a
  player is not free when the file already records a bye for them in the
  round being paired - and the team with White on board 1 has White on
  every odd board. The number of boards is the most any match of the file
  had, or `--boards=N` (needed before round 1 has been played).
