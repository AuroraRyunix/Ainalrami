defmodule Ainalrami.TeamReplay do
  @moduledoc """
  The checker's round replay (`ainalrami input.trf -c`) for a team event:
  each team round re-paired with `Ainalrami.TeamPairing` (C.04.6) from the
  history the file records before it, and compared with the pairing the
  file actually has.

  The individual replay lives in `Ainalrami.CLI` and pairs players with
  `Ainalrami.Pairing`; on a team file that compared the players' boards
  with a Dutch-system pairing of individuals, found every round different
  and exited 1. This module is the team half, and `system/1` is what tells
  the two apart.

  ## Which replay (`system/1`)

  The `192` type code decides, read by `Ainalrami.TypeCode` against FIDE's
  Tournament Type Code Table:

    * the Dutch system (`FIDE_DUTCH`, `FIDE_DUTCH_2017`, `FIDE_DUTCH_2025`)
      - the individual replay, whatever team records the file has: an
      individual open routinely lists club teams in `013` lines for a team
      prize. Accelerated (`FIDE_DUTCH*_BAKU`) the same, when the file gives
      the virtual points (`XXA` or `250`), which the engine pairs with; a
      Baku file without them is unreplayable, since the engine does not
      derive C.04.7's groups itself.
    * a C.04.6 team Swiss (`FIDE_TEAM`, `FIDE_TEAM_TYPEA_MP_GP`,
      `FIDE_TEAM_MP`, ...) - the team replay, with the settings the code
      names (below);
    * a team round robin by the Berger tables (`BERGER_TEAM_ROUNDROBIN_Gn`
      and its aliases) - `{:team_round_robin, %{games: n, code:}}`, compared
      with `Ainalrami.Berger` (`check_round_robin/3`);
    * an individual round robin (`BERGER_ROUNDROBIN_Gn` and its aliases,
      `FIDE_DOUBLEROUNDROBIN`) - `{:round_robin, %{games: n,
      reverse_last_two?:, code:}}`, read by `Ainalrami.RoundRobin`;
    * everything else is `{:unreplayable, reason}`: Schiller and Scheveningen (predetermined, by rules FIDE has not yet
      defined), knockouts, the Dubov, Burstein and Double Swiss systems
      (Ainalrami pairs the Dutch system only), every `CUSTOM_*` system, and
      an accelerated team Swiss (`Ainalrami.TeamPairing` has no
      acceleration).

  With no `192` - or one that is not in the table - the `092` type is read
  for a round robin (a team round robin when the games show a team event,
  an individual one otherwise, played as many times as its rounds need),
  Scheveningen, Schiller or knockout (unreplayable, as above), and
  otherwise the games decide: the file is a team event when, in
  every round, all the players of a team who met somebody met players of
  one and the same other team, and that team's players met theirs. An
  individual event with team records does not look like that past its
  first board.

  ## What a team Swiss code says

  The table spells the C.04.6 variants
  `FIDE_TEAM[_TYPEA|_TYPEB]_{MP|GP}[_{GP|MP}][_BAKU]`, and says:

    * `TYPEA` / `TYPEB` - Type A / Type B colour preferences (1.7.1,
      1.7.2). **Neither means "no colour preferences"** - 1.7's third
      option, "colour preferences are not to be used at all" - replayed
      with `type: :none` (see `Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Team.preference/3`).
      Until 2026-09-27 this module read a code without either as Type A,
      1.7's default; the table says otherwise.
    * the first of `MP`/`GP` - the primary score (1.2.1); the second, when
      present, the secondary score "to be used in colour allocation"
      (4.2.2); a single one - "secondary score ... not used".
    * `FIDE_TEAM` alone is `FIDE_TEAM_TYPEA_MP_GP`, and `FIDE_TEAM_BAKU`
      `FIDE_TEAM_TYPEA_MP_GP_BAKU`.

  A file with no usable `192` that the games show to be a team event is
  replayed with the C.04.6 defaults: Type A (1.7), match points primary and
  game points for colours (1.2.2) - the same as `FIDE_TEAM`.

  ## What the file's history says (`history/1`)

  Per team and round, read from the players' games in `310`/`013` order
  (the first player of a team who met somebody is its board 1, as
  `Ainalrami.Tiebreaks.Team.from_trf/2` numbers the boards) - or in the
  order of a TRF26 `300` record for the match, when the file has one:

    * **a match** against the team whose players they met. It was *played*
      when at least one board was played over the board; a match where
      every board was forfeited, or a TRF26 `330` record with no board
      records, was paired but not played (C.04.2 3.5: such teams "may be
      paired together in a future round", so it is not an opponent for
      [C1]). The team's colour is its board-1 player's (1.6.1), and a
      `330` record's white and black teams for a match with no boards.
    * **the pairing-allocated bye** - its players' `U` (or `+` with no
      opponent), or the team named for the round in a `320` record.
    * **out** of the round's pairing otherwise - sat it out, not yet
      arrived, or withdrawn.

  Match and game points are `Ainalrami.Tiebreaks.Team.from_trf/2`'s, the
  same reading the standings check uses (`362`, `320`, `330`). A team
  "won a match by forfeit" ([C2]) when that reading makes it a forfeit win -
  no board played and more game points, or a `330` record - OpenPairings'
  reading of open question 6. A team whose players all hold an `F` has a
  full-point bye, which [C2] also bars from the pairing-allocated bye.

  ## Replaying a round (`check_round/4`)

  The field is the teams the file pairs in that round (a match or the
  bye). A team out of the round that was paired in an earlier one is
  passed as `:absent`, keeping its place in 4.3.1's numbering. Each team's
  `%Ainalrami.TeamPairing.Team{}`: points so far, opponents of played
  matches, board-1 colours of played matches, whether it had the bye or won
  a match by forfeit, and whether it floated in the previous round -
  paired, played or not, against a team on a different primary score
  (1.5). The round number and the file's `142` round count switch [C7],
  [C10] and Type B's mild preferences off at the end, as the engine does.

  A round is compared in composition (who meets whom, who has the bye) and
  in colours (the team with White on board 1). Unlike the individual
  replay, a colour difference counts: Article 4 decides every team colour
  from the initial colour, and the initial colour is the file's `152`, or,
  when it has none, the one of White and Black that reproduces more of
  round 1's colours (4.3.1 gives round 1's colours from it alone).
